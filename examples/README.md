# Venafi Provider Examples

In this section you'll find functional examples you can use to better secure application delivery using _Venafi Provider for [HashiCorp Terraform](https://terraform.io/)_ with F5 BIG-IP or Citrix ADC. 

Adding Venafi enables you to manage certificates more securely as part of the TLS termination process on your application delivery controller (ADC).

**Examples:**

- [SSL Termination with F5 BIG-IP](./f5_bigip/README.md).

- [SSL Termination with Citrix ADC](./citrix_adc/README.md).
